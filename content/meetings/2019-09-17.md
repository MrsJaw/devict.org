## Board Makeup

It has been over 1 year since this board was formed. Does everyone want to
continue on the board and in their current roles?

Jacob Walker is ready to step down as President and possibly off the board
entirely.

Are there any new people that would like to join the board?

## Event Hiatus

Attendance at in-person events has been waning for quite some time. It is
demoralizing to ask speakers to present, organizers to run things, AV people to
record, and social people to promote then only have 3 people in attendance.

Jacob wants to propose a hiatus on all in-person events for October, November
and December with the exception of Code and Coffee. The intent is to give
organizers a break and possibly increase attendee demand by creating scarcity.
In the new year we could bring events back with a bang.

Study Hall specifically suffers from a lack of consistent volunteers to host.
If it is to come back after the hiatus it needs a specific champion to run it
and possibly to have a new vision.
